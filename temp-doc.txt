5.1 The command cp ../temp-* . is used to copy files that match the pattern temp-* 
from the parent directory (../) to the current directory (.).

5.2 The git init command is only needed when you want to create a new repository 
from scratch. Since we cloned an existing repository, it already contains the necessary 
Git metadata (.git folder), so we can directly track, commit, and push changes 
without reinitializing it.

5.3 
git add temp-data.csv temp-average.py, temp-doc.txt
git commit -m "Added files from my-first-project"
git push origin main
